# Introduction:
## Basics:
- `<h1>Hello World</h1>` is an **element** where the **content** `Hello World` is enclosed between an **opening tag** `<h1>` and a **closing tag** `</h1>`.
- Elements must be properly nested for consistent results. This is wrong: `<p><strong>WRONG</p></<strong>`.
- **Block vs. inline:** **Block** elements start a new line. They define paragraphs, diffs, lists, tables. Inline elements appear inside lines and only affect parts of blocks; think of a span or a heyperlink element. (Element categories in HTML5 go [beyond](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#element-content-categories) this simple binary division.)
