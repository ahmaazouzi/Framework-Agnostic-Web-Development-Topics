# CSS Basics:
- This will not be an exhaustive treatment of CSS. I will only focus on weird, interesting or challenging parts.

## What is CSS?
- CSS is for style.
- CSS is a rule-based language. It helps you define rules specifying groups of styles to elements or groups of elements. The following code shows a CSS rule:
```css
h1 {
	color: red;
	font-size: 5em;
}
```
- The rule above has the following parts:
	+ A ***selector*** is the element to be styled. In this case it is the `<h1>`.
	+ The curly braces ***`{ }`*** one or more declarations. In this example two declarations are enclosed inside the curly braces.
	+ A ***declaration*** takes the form of a ***property*** and ***value*** pair. Each property defines a property of the element (such as its size or color) and a value to be given to that value.
- CSS is also vast, so it's broken into modules. 
- **Element selectors** target and style HTML elements. To target all paragraphs in a document, you do it with the `p` selector, for example.
- Multiple selectors can be targeted at once using commas as in:
```css
p, h1 {
	font-size: 2em;
}
```
- HTML has default styling that it applies to elements. With CSS you can change this default behavior. An example of such a change can be applied to list items in a list as in the following example with the the bullets would be removed from list items or in anchors where underlining gets removed as in the following example:
```css
li {
	list-style: amharic-abegede;
}

a {
	text-decoration: none;
}
```
- A **class** is an attribute that can be added to any element and its value can be can be targeted using a class selector in CSS. The class selector is preceded by a dot as in:
```css
.special {
	color: blue;
}
```
- Any element that has a class attribute whose value is `special` will have the color blue.
- A class selector can target certain elements, so that only the given elements with that class will be targeted. This is done as follows:
```css
li.special {
	color: red;
}
```
