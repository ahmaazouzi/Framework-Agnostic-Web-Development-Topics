<h1>What I have Learnt</h1>
<b>What is the WEB??</b>
<p>The web is composed of billions of webpages, or in other words 
<em>HTML</em> documents. Each time a user requests a certain web page, they
they actually makes that request through a protocol called <em>HTTP</em>
This request is made to a <em>server</em> which then makes this page available
to the user. <a href="http://www.google.com">This site</a> has a wealth of videos
about the web and how it works.</p>
<b>The Magic of HTML</b>
<p>HTML or <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> is that programming or coding 
language that gives life and structure to any web page and the web as a whole. HTML documents are composed of two things. the content on one side, which is what a user 
sees when they interact with the document, and <em>markup tags</em>which control how 
the text and other element are displayed and structured.</p>
<b>The Components of an HTML Document</b>
<p>Each HTML documents is composed of different elemens. An <b>element</b> is composed of the contents 
itself and the markup tags that defines its structure. A <b>tag</b> can be either an aopening or a closing 
tag. the element's content are contained between these. There are also <b>void tags</b> 
which don't have closing tags and don't contain any elemen.</p>
<b>Inline vs. block tags</b>
<p><a href="www.google.com">Block elements</a> are usually used to draw and invisiblebox around elements. These 
boxes will lately be used to define the styles of HTML text. Inline tags are used in line to alter the properties 
  of line or parts of a line.
</p>
<b>Container Tag</b>
<p>These are also important, because they help witht the styling of parts of the document. <b>span</b>
  elements are inline tags, while <b>div</b> elements are block.
</p>
<b>Computers Are High-speed Idiots</b>
<p>Computers are one of the stupidest creatures on earth. It is not an insult to these things. What it actually means
is that computers <em>do axactly what you tell them.</em> One little mistake and this engineering marvel
might crash or behave in a totally unexpected fashion, so please have some <b>empathy</b> for them.</p>
